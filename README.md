* `store_signature()`: This function is used to store a digital signature in the blockchain.
  * `verify_signature()`: This function is used to verify the authenticity of a digital signature stored in the blockchain.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the blockchain module to store and verify a digital signature.

```python
# Import blockchain module
from prevention_of_communications_forgery import blockchain

# Generate digital signature
signature = generate_signature()

# Store signature in blockchain
blockchain.store_signature(signature)

# Verify signature
if blockchain.verify_signature(signature):
    print('Signature is valid!')
else:
    print('Signature is invalid!')
```

## Conclusion

The code in this repository can be used to securely store and verify communications data. It implements a blockchain module using a distributed ledger technology, which ensures that all communications data is securely stored and verified.

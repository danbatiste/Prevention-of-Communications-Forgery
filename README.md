# Prevention-of-Communications-Forgery

This GitHub repository contains code for a malicious client script and a server script that can be used to prevent communications forgery. The client script is used to send a forged instruction block to the server, while the server script verifies the instruction block and responds accordingly.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, first start the server script on the server machine, then start the client script on the client machine. The client script will then send a forged instruction block to the server which will be verified and responded to accordingly.

Example Usage:
```
# Start the server script on the server machine
$ python server.py

# Start the client script on the client machine
$ python client.py
```

## Client Script

The client script begins by establishing a socket connection between the client and server. It then defines a function, send_instruction(), which is used to send the instruction block to the server. 

The main block of code then sets a variable, next_instruction, to the hacker's address and creates a tuple, previous_block, which contains the previous block and its hash. The next_block variable is then set to the next instruction and its hash. The send_instruction() function is then called to send the forged instruction block to the server. Finally, the output of the server is printed.

## Server Script

The server script begins by establishing a socket connection between the client and server. It then defines a function, verify_instruction(), which is used to verify the instruction block sent by the client. 

The main block of code then sets a variable, next_instruction, to the hacker's address and creates a tuple, previous_block, which contains the previous block and its hash. The next_block variable is then set to the next instruction and its hash. The verify_instruction() function is then called to verify the instruction block sent by the client. If the instruction block is valid, the server will respond with a success message; otherwise, it will respond with a failure message. Finally, the output of the server is printed.

## Initialization

Sub_file_chunk #2 of __init__.py in the Prevention-of-Communications-Forgery repository is used to initialize the blockchain network. This is done by creating a new instance of the blockchain class, which takes a set of parameters as arguments. These parameters include the network's difficulty level, the number of blocks to be mined, and the amount of time it takes to mine a block. Once the blockchain network is initialized, it can be used to securely store, track, and verify digital assets.

## Usage

To use the Prevention-of-Communications-Forgery repository, first import the blockchain module from the same directory. This is done by using the following code:

```python
from Prevention-of-Communications-Forgery import blockchain
```

Once the blockchain module is imported, you can then initialize the blockchain network. This is done by creating a new instance of the blockchain class, which takes a set of parameters as arguments. These parameters include the network's difficulty level, the number of blocks to be mined, and the amount of time it takes to mine a block.

For example, the following code creates a blockchain network with a difficulty level of 5, 10 blocks to be mined, and a mining time of 30 seconds:

```python
blockchain_network = blockchain.Blockchain(5, 10, 30)
```

Once the blockchain network is initialized, it can be used to securely store, track, and verify digital assets.

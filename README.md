# Prevention of Communications Forgery

This GitHub repository contains code designed to prevent communications forgery. It consists of two files: `malicious_client.py` and `__init__.py`.

## malicious_client.py

This script is designed to send a malicious instruction to a server. The malicious instruction is sent in the form of a forged instruction block which contains the hacker's desired command. The script first creates a socket connection to the server and then defines a function `send_instruction` which is used to send the forged block. The function takes the instruction block as an argument and uses the pickle module to serialize the block before sending it to the server. The script then prints out the forged instruction block and sends it to the server using the `send_instruction` function. The output of the function is then printed out. The purpose of this script is to demonstrate how a malicious client can send a forged instruction block to a server in order to gain access to resources or cause harm.

## __init__.py

This code imports the `blockchain` module from the same repository. The purpose of this code is to allow the code in the `blockchain` module to be used in other files within the same repository. This enables the code in the `blockchain` module to be used and accessed in other files within the repository. This code is used to facilitate the prevention of communications forgery by allowing the code in the `blockchain` module to be used and accessed in other files.

## Usage

The code in this repository can be used to prevent communications forgery by ensuring that any instructions sent to a server are properly authenticated. The `malicious_client.py` script can be used to demonstrate how a malicious client can send a forged instruction block to a server. The `__init__.py` code can be used to allow the `blockchain` module to be used and accessed in other files within the repository.

To use the code in this repository, first run `__init__.py` to import the `blockchain` module. Then, run `malicious_client.py` to create a socket connection to the server and send a forged instruction block. Finally, use the `blockchain` module to verify the instruction block and ensure that it has not been tampered with.

Example:

```
$ python __init__.py
Importing blockchain module...

$ python malicious_client.py
Creating socket connection to server...
Sending forged instruction block...

$ python blockchain.py
Verifying instruction block...
Instruction block is valid.
```
